This app is a mix, you will see that it is possible to combine SwiftUI on UIKit applications.

## What can I do?

You can do almost everything

* Go to a SwiftUI View from UIKit view by Storyboard and by code.
* Pass data to a SwiftUI view from UIKit by Storyboard and by code.
* Send data back from SwiftUI View to UIKit View.
* You can create complex UIs on SwiftUI.
* You can use UIKit components from UIKit in SwiftUI.

Well... not almost everything, you can do everything!.

## Conclusion

SwiftUI seems to be the future, the new way to code, there is no reason to give it a try, you don't have to completely forget your UIKit knowledge, you can just add this new technology to your current ones.
